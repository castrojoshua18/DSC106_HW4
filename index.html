        <h2> Discussion </h2>
        <h3>Fig. 1: the Timeline</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            With the timeline, I wanted to show the consumer how Boseman has evolved into the star that he is now. Though Boseman is most
            recognized for this work as <i>T'Challa, the Black Panther</i>, he has worked from smaller support roles and lead roles within
            movies that are not as large scale as Disney's superhero movies. I chose to highlight "Lead" events with brown so that consumers
            can easily spot where Boseman took on lead roles while ntentionally choosing this darker color to pay respect to his African-American
            heritage and his work to bring more color into lead roles within the movie industry.
        </p>

        <h3>Fig. 3: the Radar Chart</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            With the radar chart, I wanted to subtly connect the information from this chart to the timeline, hence the use of similar
            color-scheme. The motivation with this chart was to pair Boseman's growth into the star that he is now with his choice of
            genres to act within. I chose the radar chart because it can give consumers a quick and easy medium to understand 
            Boseman's movie genre breakdown to relate back to findings in the timeline.
