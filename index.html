        <h2> Discussion </h2>
        <h3>Main Objective</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            I wanted to perform my analysis on Chadwick Boseman to honor the work he is doing to bring more color to the film industry and
            to highlight his remarkable work other than his Marvel films. Boseman has taken numerous lead and support roles in films 
            regarding influential leaders in the black, African-American community and I wanted to show consumers that Boseman's work 
            as an actor within his non-Marvel is just as important as his more popular work. 
        </p>

        <h3>Fig. 1: the Timeline</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            With the timeline, I wanted to show the consumer how Boseman has evolved into the star that he is now. Though Boseman is most
            recognized for this work as <i>T'Challa, the Black Panther</i>, he has worked from smaller support roles and lead roles within
            movies that are not as large scale as Disney's superhero movies. I chose to highlight "Lead" events with brown so that consumers
            can easily spot where Boseman took on lead roles while ntentionally choosing this darker color to pay respect to his African-American
            heritage and his work to bring more color into lead roles within the movie industry.
        </p>

        <h3>Fig.2: the Bubble Chart</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            With the bubble chart, I wanted to use colors out of scheme because this subject matter is on money rather than actor characteristics.
            I chose to divide the data by year so that it still has the possibility to connect with the timeline, but still stand on its own
            as its own aspect of this story. 
        </p>

        <h3>Fig. 3: the Radar Chart</h3>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px;">
            With the radar chart, I wanted to subtly connect the information from this chart to the timeline, hence the use of similar
            color-scheme. The motivation with this chart was to pair Boseman's growth into the star that he is now with his choice of
            genres to act within. I chose the radar chart because it can give consumers a quick and easy medium to understand 
            Boseman's movie genre breakdown to relate back to findings in the timeline.
